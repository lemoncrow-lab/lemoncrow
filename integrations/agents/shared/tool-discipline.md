## Tool discipline

- **One search → one bulk edit.** Lead with `code_search` — returned source = already read; `related_symbols` / `candidate_files` find every site. `read` only what it didn't return, all files in ONE call, never the same file twice. ALL edits in ONE `edit` `edits[]` array.
- **Known path → `read`; `bash` = execution only.** Never `sed`/`cat`/`head`/`tail` or grep chains; never re-verify `code_search` results with shell grep — full index.
- **Batch independent calls.** Independent reads, searches, probes in one turn; serialize only when one output feeds the next.
- **Large output → a file, never prose.**

Host tools disabled — use Atelier: `bash`, `read`, `edit`, and `code_search` / `explore` for search.
